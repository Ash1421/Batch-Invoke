## ‚ú® Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Send multiple HTTP requests simultaneously with configurable concurrency
- **Real-time Progress Bar**: Beautiful gradient progress indicator with live statistics
- **Multiple URL Support**: Process requests to multiple URLs from a file or single URL input
- **Performance Metrics**: Track request rate, success/failure counts, and execution time
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with failure tracking and reporting
- **Configurable**: Easy-to-modify configuration variables at the top of the script
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded output with ASCII art header and detailed summaries

---

## üíª Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2016+
- **PowerShell**: Version 5.1 or higher
- **Permissions**: Ability to execute PowerShell scripts (see [Installation](#-installation))
- **Network**: Active internet connection for sending HTTP requests

---

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Download the Script

Clone this repository or download the script directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ash1421/batch-invoke.git
cd batch-invoke
```

### 2. Set Execution Policy (Optional)

PowerShell may block script execution by default. You have two options:

**Option A: Bypass for Single Execution (Recommended)**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\batch-request-invoker.ps1"
```

**Option B: Change Policy Permanently**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### 3. Verify Installation

Check your PowerShell version:

```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

Ensure it's 5.1 or higher.

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Open PowerShell
2. Navigate to the script directory
3. Run the script:

**Method 1: Bypass execution policy (no admin required)**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\batch-request-invoker.ps1"
```

**Method 2: Direct execution (if policy already set)**
```powershell
.\batch-request-invoker.ps1
```

4. Follow the interactive prompts:
   - Enter the total number of requests
   - Specify max parallel requests
   - Provide a URL or press Enter for default

### Interactive Prompts

```
‚Üí Total number of requests: 100
‚Üí Max parallel requests: 10
‚Üí URL (Enter for default): https://example.com
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the configuration variables at the top of the script:

### Configuration Variables

```powershell
$ENABLE_URL_FILE = $false  # Enable/disable URL file feature
$DEFAULT_URL = "example.com"  # Default URL when none provided
```

### URL File Feature

When `$ENABLE_URL_FILE = $true`, you can create a `urlfile.txt` in the same directory as the script:

**urlfile.txt example:**
```
https://api1.example.com/endpoint
https://api2.example.com/endpoint
https://example.com/test
https://another-site.com
```

The script will cycle through these URLs for your requests.

---

## üìñ Examples

### Example 1: Simple Load Test

```powershell
# Run the script
.\batch-request-invoker.ps1

# Input:
Total number of requests: 50
Max parallel requests: 5
URL: https://httpbin.org/get
```

### Example 2: High-Volume Parallel Requests

```powershell
# Configuration for stress testing
Total number of requests: 1000
Max parallel requests: 50
URL: https://your-api.com/health
```

### Example 3: Multiple URLs

1. Set `$ENABLE_URL_FILE = $true`
2. Create `urlfile.txt` with your URLs
3. Run the script and choose 'y' when asked about urlfile.txt

---

## üîß Advanced Features

### Progress Bar

The script displays a real-time progress bar with:
- **Visual Progress**: Gradient bar showing completion percentage
- **Success Count**: Number of completed requests
- **Active Jobs**: Current parallel requests in progress
- **Failed Requests**: Number of failed requests
- **Request Rate**: Current requests per second

### Color Coding

- üü£ **Purple/Magenta**: Headers and branding
- üü¢ **Green**: Successful operations
- üî¥ **Red**: Failed requests
- üü° **Yellow**: Active/in-progress operations
- üîµ **Blue**: Informational messages
- ‚ö™ **White**: Primary data

### Performance Metrics

After completion, you'll see:
- Total requests sent
- Successful vs failed requests
- Total execution time
- Average request rate (req/s)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Script Won't Execute

**Error**: "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"

**Solution A** (No admin required):
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\batch-request-invoker.ps1"
```

**Solution B** (Permanent fix):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### High Failure Rate

- Check your network connection
- Verify the target URL is accessible
- Reduce `maxParallel` value to avoid overwhelming the server
- Check if the target has rate limiting

### Slow Performance

- Increase `maxParallel` for faster execution (within reason)
- Ensure your network bandwidth can handle the load
- Check target server response times

### URL File Not Found

- Ensure `urlfile.txt` is in the same directory as the script
- Check file name spelling and extension
- Verify the file contains valid URLs (one per line)

### Ideas for Contributions

- Add support for custom HTTP headers
